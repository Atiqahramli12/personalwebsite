So, this is my small but not so small family. I have 4 siblings including me. The eldest is my sister, Nur Amira Binti Ramli born in 1994. Currently, she is 27 years old and currently working at Secret Recipe HQ in HR department. She is now happily married to her husband in November 2019. My brother-in-law is 27 years old, originally from Cheras, Selangor and currently working at Affin Bank, Kuala Lumpur. I am so happy to see them both happy. while the second one is my brother, Muhammad Amirul Bin Ramli born in 1996, is now 25 years old and already working at MKM Travel & Tours. Next, the third child is definitely me, born in 2000, now 21 years old and still pursuing a degree at UiTM. Last but not least is my younger brother who was born in 2007, is now 14 years old and still in high school. We were all born and raised in Selangor.

Next is my parents. My father's name is Ramli bin Ahmad Razali. He hails from Gombak, Selangor and was born on April 5, 1970. He is firm and strict but at the same time a funny, gentle and loving person towards his family. Currently, he is working at Bursa Malaysia Berhad in Depository Department. My mother's name is Nor Aeshah binti Sulaiman. She hails from Bagan Datoh, Perak and was born on April 3, 1970. After marrying my father, my mother no longer worked to take care of us siblings. She is fierce but at the same time she is very loving towards us. She never let us sleep in hunger because all her dishes were our favorites. I really love my mom’s cooking because it’s the best! I can’t imagine my life without my mother's cooking.
